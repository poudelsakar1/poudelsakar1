The Platform has consolidated the cryptocurrency market, thus providing institutional investors with the best way to invest in cryptocurrencies. The Platform aggregates all leading exchanges, comparing cryptocurrency prices in real time. We support over 2,100 cryptocurriences, draw data from 165 exchanges, offer execution on over 20 exchanges, and draw research data and news from all the leading sites in the space. We will add the consolidation of custodians to the platform shortly.Working as a core front end developer in BCT technical team, I built just the frontend part.
